# Script to automatically send a target boxes from USPS

# Description
This script is to show that even decades later, boxes can be spammed to a target address
for the sake of irritation. A max of 500 boxes can be sent, but that is for only ONE order or ONE account.
This can leads to an attacker sending thousands of boxes throughout the day, week, etc. to a given target.

* Key Note
    - This no longer is working since yesterday due to them taking the option to deliver boxes for free down..
    - We will see how they go about mitigating such and go from there in a later time.
    - For now I'm going to leave this code here as a base. (Never tried it with premade accounts ðŸ‘€)
